Welcome to my audio narrative project!
For this project, I recorded me and my roommate making a soup dinner. I mixed lots of different audio elements which can be found around my house during an evening like this. Anyone who listens to this should hopefully feel like they are sitting in my kitchen with us while we prepare and eat dinner.
